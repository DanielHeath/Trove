== Welcome to Trove

Trove is a web-based application that manages treasure for P&P roleplaying games like D&D.
It is also capable of compositing images to generate treasure cards you can hand to your players.
Trove is written by Daniel Heath (daniel.r.heath@gmail.com). 
Feel free to use it yourself if you know what you're doing. 
I make no promises to you. If it doesn't work, and you ask me nicely, I might help you get started with it if I have time.
